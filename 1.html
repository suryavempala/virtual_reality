				Aptitude Tests<br>
suggested material:<a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/placements/"> http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/placements/ </a><br>
You will be taking an aptitude test set by the company.<br>
 And since you know about it, you can prepare by taking online aptitude tests. <br>
There are many websites with tough aptitude tests that can really help you get the hang of aptitude tests and do well. <br>
Use your free time to do these freely available tests.<br>
You can look for tests based on your educational discipline and start preparing. <br>
For example, if you are an engineering student, there are aptitude tests for engineers. <br>
If you are a management student, you can look for management aptitude tests. And these tests are quite easy to find online.<br>

				<h2>STEP-5:</h2> 
			</div> 
					
			<p> 
				communication skills
Work on your English speaking and writing skills. In India, English is the official language businesses communicate. <br>
Therefore, to increase your chances of being selected as a candidate, work on your English writing and speaking skills. <br>
Recruiters will test both of these during your interview.<br>
Always try to converse in English with your friends and family. <br>
Read a lot of books, magazines, and newspapers. This will also help you increase your vocabulary. <br>
Also, get into the practice of writing a journal. Many talented candidates even get rejected owing to poor communication skills, so take this seriously.<br>

If you are getting educated in a technical discipline, be sure to brush up on your technical knowledge and skills.<br>
In campus placements interviews, there is a lot of importance placed on technical skills, and you will be mostly grilled about your technical knowledge.<br>
Keep reading and updating your technical knowledge. Practical work is the best way to do this. <br>
More than anything else, this is what recruiters are concerned with and if you can display your technical knowledge and skills, you are bound to get selected for a job.<br>

			<p> 
				Mock Interviews<br>
One of the most nerve-wracking parts of the placement process is the one-on-one interviews. <br>
Campus placements are probably the first time you are facing an interview. Therefore, it is quite natural to be nervous.<br> 
But there is a way you can deal with your nerves and do well in the interview – mock interviews.<br>
Many colleges conduct mock interview exercises as a way to help their students prepare for placements.<br>
 Make sure you are a part of them. You can also practice mock interviews with your friends as a means to prepare. <br>
This will truly help you.

			<p> 
				Group Discussion<br>
A few times, this round is not conducted, but many companies use this for filtering candidates.<br>
 A group of students is created that is moderated by a judge. A common topic is given for the group to discuss.<br> 
Once the discussions begin, students are judged on their knowledge, their communication skills, their confidence, their leadership skills, and their listening and retaining capabilities.<br>
 In the GD round, the latest news and current affairs are discussed, so you need to brush up on your knowledge.<br>
